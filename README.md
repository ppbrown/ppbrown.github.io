I have many github repos. Some of them are "throwaway" ones, or temporary experiments. Some are clones I created just to submit one PR to upstream.
The ones below, however, may be of interest.

* [ZRep](https://github.com/bolthole/zrep/) (bash) - My ZFS based snapshot, backup, and recovery system
* VLM Utils (python) - Utilities that may be useful with Visual Language (AI) Models
* AI Training (python) - Utilities for training an AI Model
* OneTrainerQt (python) - My port of the OneTrainer program to use Qt widgets instead of TkInter
* FreeHA (bash,C) - Building blocks to make your own crossplatform Highly Available cluster
* ElasticSearch Utils (bash) - CLI shortcut wrappers around a few commands
